# ASP-Tracker
The ASP Tracker is used to keep live, up to date daily and weekly numbers for a metric called Attachment-selling-program (ASP).
This was written at the request of a formanger in a retail store, in order to help improve the teams performance in this metric.

The program allows users to input what product they sold, and how many items were sold with it.
The program reads from a .csv file when it is opened and writes all data to it. It keeps track of
daily and weekly sales.
A custom input allows the removal of an incorrect input, aswell as adding in multiple sales at once.

The reset button will allow the user to reset the daily sales numbers, weekly sales numbers, or both.
The program also has an automatic reset function, which resets the daily numbers every 24 hours and
the weekly every sunday.

When 8 or more items are attached to an item, a parrot will dance across the screen.
The parrot was obtained from https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/ , Where many more parrots can
also be viewed.
